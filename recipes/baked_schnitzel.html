    <h1>Baked Chicken Schnitzel</h1>

    <img src="/images/baked_schnitzel.jpg" class="good-img">

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Chicken schnitzel is a breeze to make in the oven. Plus, this method uses less oil and has easier cleanup. The breaded chicken breasts are baked until golden and crispy on the outside, yet they're still tender and juicy on the inside. Serve schnitzels with lemon wedges and a German-style potato salad.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds veal</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 cups bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/8 cup oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3> 

    <ol>
        <li>Cut the veal into steaks, about as thick as your finger. Dredge in flour. In a shallow dish, beat the eggs with 1 tablespoon oil, salt and pepper. Coat the veal with egg mixture, then with bread crumbs.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/4 cup oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Fry veal until golden brown, about 5 minutes on each side.</li>
    </ol>
